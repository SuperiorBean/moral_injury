      witnessing a life-threatening event, like combat, a natural disaster, a car accident, or sexual assualt, etc.
      During these kind of events, the person may not have any control over what's happening, and may feel afraid.

        Whats the difference between PTSD and Moral Injury
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Moral Injury is not classified as a mental disorder. It is a demensional problem that can have profound
          effects on critical domains of emotional, psychological, behavioral, social, and spiritual functioning.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is possible to have moral injury and not meet criteria for PTSD even though core features of moral injury
          overlap with symptoms and common features of PTSD.

      <h3>
        Whats the similarities between PTSD and Moral Injury
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Experiencing trauma does not inevitably lead to developing PTSD. Moral Injury is determined by how the
          individual interprets the potentially injurious event.
        </li>
        <li>
          Both begin with an event that is often life threatening of harmful to self or others.
        </li>
        <li>
          Guilt and shame are core features of moral injury and are also symptoms of PTSD.
